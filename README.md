## tech interview process 
Use R.E.A.C.T.O approach

- repeat
- examples
- approach
- code 
- test
- optimization

--------------

## R for Repeat
make sure to repeat the question to make sure we have a full understanding of the problem. 

## E for Example
Get examples of variables we will be working on and the expected output . Write out a table with params that will be used in a function and the output to expect. This will help you better understand what the function is supposed to solve and how to get there 

## A for Approach 
Describe your approaches . Give insight into logic and thought process. Use this stage to gauge the interviewer in case you are on a wrong path . Keep talking about your thinking and not what is going on in the code 

## C for Code
actually start coding out the problem. Decompose  the approach  into high lever functions at a higher level . Break down the problem into little separate functions. DOn't waste time on minor issues - highlight potential problem areas 

Leave additional room for edits and new lines of code  (useful for whiteboard interviews )
highlight (star) things that you are not sure about , indicate that this needs to be revisited to highlight your confidence level 

use psudo code ( in english ) that can also be revisited 

## T for  Test 
where applicable test the solution with different set of params . Use params outside of the expected param sets to highlight problems with the function and start catching errors 

## O for Optimization
think on the level  that takes into account code performance when it comes down to scaling . What will happen if the number of operations will increase significantly
